          Disclosure to third parties and overseas recipients
        </h2>
        <p>
          We may share personal information with trusted service providers who help us operate,
          such as hosting platforms, analytics providers, payment gateways, customer relationship tools,
          or subcontractors engaged to deliver a project. These third parties only access the data needed
          to perform their services and must keep it confidential.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some providers are located outside Australia (including the United States, European Union,
          and Asia-Pacific regions). When information is transferred overseas we take reasonable steps to
          ensure recipients comply with the APPs or comparable safeguards.

          We retain personal information only for as long as it is required for the purpose for which it was collected
