"bio":"I was raised and born in sunny Portugal, moved to Berlin, Germany, to discover what I wanted to do with my life. Ended up growing a lot as a human being, met the love of my life, had two children and have now relocated back to the Sunshine Coast, where my wife is originally from. What a journey! If this has taught me anything, it's that there is no limits to what one can do. There is nothing better than challenging yourself.

One of my strengths since I was a small child was foreign languages, I always had an fun time learning them, speaking them, so much so, that my longest relationship ever has been with the German language itself ðŸ˜€. That is why I moved to Germany in the first place, and that was how I ended up realising how much I love to teach people how to be more confident when learning a new language. I built a great background in adult language teaching and training, but something was missing though. 

In fact, what was missing was another language. But this time, I decided to learn one from a very different character: the language of computers. That is how I ended up pivoting into tech. And despite it being the most challenging one so far, I have loved every minute of the process.

I also want for people to love every step of the way when they decide to either launch or grow their online presence. If you have any questions how this can me done or maybe you just need to talk some ideas out, feel free to give me a call! Just click the button below and let's get online!"}
