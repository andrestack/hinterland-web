I was born in sunny Portugal, moved to Berlin, Germany, to discover what I wanted to do with my life. During those years I grew into the human being I am today, met the love of my life, had two beautiful children and we all have now relocated to the Sunshine Coast, where my wife is originally from, to start a brave new adventure. 

### What a journey! 

If this has taught me anything, it's that there is no limits to what one can do. There is nothing better than challenging yourself.

One of my strengths since I was a small child was foreign languages, I always had an fun time learning them, speaking them and that was exactly what made me move to Germany: no only did I want to continue improving my skills, but I already had fallen in love with the ever so vibrant city of Berlin. After a couple of odd jobs and a masters degree, I discovered my passion for teaching German and helping people to become more confident confident when learning a new language. After many years and hours in a classroom teaching students and training new teachers, I felt that something was missing.

Having thaught German to so many people in some great tech companies like SoundCloud, Google and HelloFresh, my curiosity about what all these developers do in their day to day work life started to grow. Some of them were implement new ticketing tools, other a new way of creating curated lists. It all felt incredible to hear, because these were real life implementations of something you and your team build. Not much different than learning a classical language and go out there try it, make friends, get a new job and immerse yourself in a new life. So I switch from line in a text into lines in a code base.

This move could have not been more challenging! But after building my first website for a Drum and Dance [event](www.aldeia-djembe-camp.com) a friend and I organise in Portugal, I have not looked back! If I am not developing client or not-for-profits websites, you will usually find me helping open source projects or transform some annyoing habit, like doomscrolling on Instagram, into something practical, like a collection of all tools I find relevant for my line of work and interests.

If you are having a hard time understanding how to either launch or grow your online presence, don't worry! You are not alone and unknown waters can be terryfying. I have been there a couple of times myself and know how it feels like. Do you have any questions how this can me done or maybe you just need to talk some ideas out, feel free to give me a call!
